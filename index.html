    alert("hey lilo")
    alert("u know, i’ve been decoding the mysteries of the cosmos and tackling algorithms that even einstein would’ve raised an eyebrow at, but there’s one equation that keeps tripping me up: the lilo+forsythe dynamic.")
    alert("it’s like trying to solve for X in a fourth-dimensional space, fascinatingly complex yet beautifully simple when you break it down.")
    alert("just like in the sci-fi flicks where the hero finally gets it, i’ve come to realize that my ultimate discovery isn’t some far-off galaxy or a groundbreaking tech breakthrough; it’s you.")
    alert("you’re the missing variable that makes the entire equation of my life make sense.")
    alert("just like a programmer tweaking code to perfection, every moment with you feels like we’re optimizing our shared experience, making it richer and more vibrant.")
    alert("you're the unexpected variable that made my life's equation make perfect sense, and i don't need any debugger to tell me that we're meant to be.")
    alert("alright, cut the crap that only i understand. i don't want to confuse you any longer.")
    alert("so you know how they say every great movie has that one epic love story, right?")
    alert("well, i think we’ve got the plot twist that everyone's rooting for.")
    alert("whenever i'm around you, it's like we’re living in a rom-com where every scene is filled with laughs, winks, and those moments that make my heart skip a beat.")
    alert("you're the plot twist i never saw coming but now can't imagine living without.")
    alert("you’ve got this way of making life hit different, your words turn the ordinary into something i wanna remember.")
    alert("life’s like a playlist and you’re my favorite song, the one i wanna hit repeat on every day.")
    alert("you’re the sparkle in my eye, the melody that’s always stuck in my head, and the reason i smile a little extra every day.")
    alert("every time we talk, it’s like the universe is throwing confetti, feel like there’s something magical between us.")
    alert("and every time you're around, it's like the sun decided to throw a party just for me, and i can't help but feel like the luckiest guy in the room.")
    alert("you've got me all wrapped up in knots with that smile of yours, and i can't help but think about you all the time.")
    alert("you're like the missing piece to my puzzle, the wild card that makes every day an adventure worth taking.")
    alert("so, here’s the deal, lilo. i’m falling for you, hard and fast, like a skateboard on a downhill ride.")
    alert("i want to be the one who makes you laugh when you're sad, share your secrets, and maybe steal a few more of those sweet moments together.")
    alert("it’s like the line “do i wanna know if this feeling flows both ways?” because i’m here, totally into you, wondering if you’re feeling the same thing.")
    alert("truly, you've turned my life into a rom-com marathon where every scene feels like it's straight out of a heartwarming montage.")
    alert("so here's my grand finale confession, you've cast a spell on me, and now i'm just a goofy protagonist hoping you'll be my leading lady in this crazy adventure called life.")
    alert("we can defy the laws of physics, surpass the speed of light, and create a universe where our love is the ultimate constant. i promise our journey will be filled with laughter, genius discoveries, and the kind of moments that sci-fi dreams are made of.")
    alert("what do u say, lilo?")
    alert("forever enraptured by your essence, your kasep soleh, forsythe")
